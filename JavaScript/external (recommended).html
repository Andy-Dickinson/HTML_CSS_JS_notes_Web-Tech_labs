        <!-- Faster than the other methods of implementing js
             If two pages use the same JavaScript external file then instead of loading it twice, as
             would happen if the JavaScript was between <script> tags in the respective HTML files, instead
             it is downloaded for the first page that your user navigates to then is saved in the browser and
             reused, but not re-downloaded, when referenced from the other file. This can lead to large saving
             in network bandwidth but also better performance of your sites as loading from local memory is
             nearly always much faster than reloading across the network -->
