/* Position attribute can have 5 different settings:
Static - default starting position of element, can also be used to reset
    something which has previously been set to a different position
Relative - shift element around page relative to original position
    note left moves the element AWAY FROM the left edge (ie right - or relative to left edge)
    bottom moves element AWAY FROM the bottom edge (ie up - or relative to bottom edge)
Fixed - relative to viewport (window) so fixed position with left and 
    top set to 0 would fix element in position whilst scrolling down the page.
    These again are relative to the left edge, and top edge (can also set relative to the other edges too)
    Note other elements will be treated as if fixed element is not there,
    so can loose elements behind it. Maybe try sticky instead?
Absolute - positions element absolutely relative to its parent element 
    when the parent ALSO has a position property applied to it (ie not static)
Sticky - Static to begin with, then fixed when scroll position on a    
    page reaches a certain point
